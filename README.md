# GPE-simulator

This project calculates the gravitational potential energy (GPE) of an object in a gravitational field. the simulator calculates how GPE changes as the object moves at different distances from the planet. The code takes the masses of both objects and the range of distances as inputs, then plots how GPE changes with distance.
